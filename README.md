This repo contains the remains of a project me and my mate did. Woe is ye to whom trespasses...
This contains the animations, scripts, scenes, assets, cutscenes etc of the 2D top down game we "attempted" to create

Some Context Here : 
We began our game development project with extensive brainstorming and refinement of the game concept, focusing on innovation and player engagement. After learning Unity and C# through various resources, we created game assets using Photoshop and GIMP. Initial development involved pivoting from an isometric top-down design to a rectangular top-down design due to technical challenges. Iterative development followed, emphasizing gameplay mechanics, performance optimization, and polishing. We implemented advanced features including topological sorting for sprite layering, a 3-state AI system with mesh generation and A* pathfinding for dynamic behavior, and an Animation Controller in Unity to manage animation transitions and states, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.
